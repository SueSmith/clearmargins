_In progress_

<!--

I've been thinking a lot about discomfort recently. Three years ago I was diagnosed with cervical cancer and over the next year had successful treatment. Earlier in 2024 I was discharged and am no longer a cancer patient. I work in education and try to prioritise being a learner – as you can likely imagine, having cancer was a very good learning opportunity. Again and again during this time I've been confronted with how frequently people center their own discomfort, and I've become increasingly convinced it's a problem we need to solve in order to tackle our most urgent challenges, from poverty to racism and climate crisis.

When you get a cancer diagnosis people behave in some pretty fucked up ways. If you've ever had someone act weirdly around you because you were grieving you'll be familiar with the pattern. It makes people uncomfortable, they want the discomfort to go away, so they do whatever they think will make that happen in the moment. Typically that action makes the situation more isolating for the person going through whatever crisis has prompted this behaviour. I have shallower relationships with some people than before, it becomes difficult to interact with authenticity afterwards. I get it, it's uncomfortable, but it's just a bit of discomfort, you can surely tolerate it – want to know what's really uncomfortable? Having fucking cancer lol.

Around the time I was experiencing these frustrating cancer conversations we had one of the first waves of folk leaving Twitter. People were mostly moving to Mastodon, which was the primary alternative social network available at the time. But a pattern of behaviour on this decentralised platform basically put paid to significant adoption among Black people. Mastodon has a culture of using content warnings to label – and by default hide – content that may trigger a sensitivity. 

Here was this pattern again, centering your own discomfort in a situation where your discomfort wasn't the most important factor.

it's a negotation between individual and community interests that's complex and messy, but navigating it without some reckoning with privilege and intersectionality is imo a doomed venture
